                <p>"You have truly made a difference to us, and we are extremely grateful! We felt that our lives would end when the disease was reported. But because of you, donors--you make our faces shine again. My children are able to eat loaves of bread because of your support. They usually say we have our lovely and caring mother named Shirley in US. They need to meet her, and I usually tell them one day by God's will we will meet."</p>

                <p>"My name is Marcy from Kenya. I am a mother of three, two young boys and a little girl approaching 7 months old. When I was expectant with my daughter, my husband threw us out and had a new wife. Life hit rock bottom for us and I sought refuge at a friend's place. Unfortunately, my friend had accrued so much rent arrears and we were forced out. Having nowhere to go and with a new born baby, Unite in Love came in handy for us...provided us with a roof over our head and fed us. It has taken the hand of God that by his grace we live today to appreciate all that has been done unto us. I sincerely appreciate all the donors who have dug deep into their pockets to give hope unto the hopeless. I count myself blessed and a great beneficiary of Unite in Love for when I gave birth to my daughter,I developed health complications (post-partum haemorrhage) and the bill grew bigger...Unite in Love gave me the courage to go on each day fighting for better days,it helped foot my hospital bills. To date I am grateful for what Unite in Love does to people like me...its impact is felt worldwide,and what else could we do or say? A word of gratitude to our God whose providence has always been upon us and his usage of Unite in Love as a vessel to reach us. I am humbled. May God richly bless all the selfless donors who have always given as a chance to stay hopeful."</p>

                <p>"Since May last year I, my family and my ministry have been helped and supported by Unite in Love, through the blessings and the will of our donors. The whole of these days I eat; also have received all kinds of support from Unite in Love (for hospital bill, seeds for planting and fertilizers). I also introduced Obonyo's family to this ministry as they have also been supported through this ministry. They are suffering from elephantiasis; they are really suffering as they are not able to raise funds for hospital bills, but Unite in Love has been close to them through your support (donation). On behalf of Obonyo's family, thanks to all and may all the blessings of God be with you."</p>

                <p>"First of all I am thankful to God who is very merciful and loves us very much. I am also thankful to sister Shirley Cheng. She is also merciful and she loves humanity, helping and struggling for needy and poor people. I am also very thankful to donors who are donating to sister Shirley Cheng for needy peoples and sick and disable peoples. For one year sister has been helping with food money nine families, and another one recently; not only helping with food but for one disable person helped with wheelchair, and for one lady with walker and medicines, and helps three families in house rent."</p>

            <div>
                <p>"By the time Unite in Love found me, I and my family was hopeless, struggling with what to eat. We were in house rent arrears and the landlord had given us an eviction letter to vacate his house by September 1, 2020!
                    As the fundraiser comes close to a year, I take this golden opportunity to thank all our gracious donors who have sacrificially stood with us in providing us with foodstuffs, house rent, medication, a Solar Cooker, and covering our pit latrine hole.
                    Our prayers for our gracious donors is always that Yahweh meet you at your point of need--Proverbs 19:17: "He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh; He will reward him.
                    May Yahweh abundantly bless all our gracious donors in Jesus' Name. Dear Dr. Shirley thank you so much for thinking about the less privileged by founding Unite in Love fundraiser to care for our needs; for sure you're brother's keeper and a real friend, for a friend in need is a friend indeed!
                    Thank you for wiping tears from our eyes, satisfying the empty stomachs and putting a roof over us. Thank you for your faithfulness towards Yahweh, our gracious donors and to us; you're such an amazing vessel, Sister. May God Almighty bless you spiritually, physically and materially in Jesus' Name."

                <p>"I met Dr. Shirley on the 28th of June, 2020, in a group on Facebook. It was during the lockdown when I hardly fed well as a breastfeeding mom together with my two older daughters. We had to starve because I had no hope as a single mother of three girls that was abandoned by her husband. The first day I spoke to Dr. Shirley about our situation, she felt pity for us and started feeding me and my girls immediately, and also helped us on the 22nd of December, 2020, to pay our rent for 6 months. She feeds us every month and provides for us medically through the Unite in Love fundraiser.
                    From the bottom of my heart I'm grateful. I and my daughters really appreciate your concern, help and support. Thank you so very much for your love and support to me and my daughters through your donations when we thought all hope was lost. I could remember how my girls used to cry because of hunger. I can't thank you Angels enough. May the almighty God continue to bless you and your family in abundance in Jesus' name, amen."

                <p>"Hello to every person whose heart's been touched who's been donating to me and my family and other people living in my community through Shirley Cheng (Unite in Love fundraiser). The fundraiser has been a blessing to me and my family and other people within my community. All I can say is thanks much for your help toward families around the world. May the almighty God bless every supporter because your donation brings smiles to our faces. To Shirley, may the almighty  God give you strength to keep running your project and I pray that by His grace it will grow bigger and turn into an organization worldwide."</p>

                <p>"After I was forced to stop working because of the pandemic, Cheng has been very supportive to my family, including my grandmother I stay with. Here's my grandmother's words in our local language: mbuyamonomaraika oyo, as ogokonya kwao asende, nkoragera. Na gwesibi, amo namabuta Amaya nkweaka. Unite in Love has really played a major role of seeing to that people not go hungry. Thanks so much."</p>
